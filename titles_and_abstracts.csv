"FUTURE TRENDS IN ORGANIC FLOUR MILLING: THE ROLE OF AI","THE MILLING OF WHEAT FLOUR IS A PROCESS THAT HAS EXISTED SINCE ANCIENT TIMES. IN THE COURSE OF HISTORY, THE TECHNIQUES HAVE IMPROVED, THE EQUIPMENT MODERNIZED. THE INTEREST OF THE MILLER IN CHARGE OF THE MILL IS STILL TO ENSURE THAT A MILL IS FUNCTIONAL AND PROFITABLE, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT QUALITY OF FLOUR. THE PRODUCTION OF ORGANIC FLOUR MEANS THAT METHODS OF ADDING CHEMICALS AND UNNATURAL AGENTS ARE NOT POSSIBLE. IN ORGANIC FLOUR PRODUCTION, IT IS NECESSARY TO WORK WITH THE RAW MATERIAL. A GRAIN OF WHEAT IS A LIVING MATERIAL, AND ITS QUALITY VARIES ACCORDING TO A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS. CHALLENGES ARE THEREFORE PRESENT AT EACH STAGE OF THE VALUE CHAIN. THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES OFFERS SOLUTIONS AND NEW PERSPECTIVES TO MEET THE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES OF THE MILLER. A LITERATURE REVIEW OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED AT EACH STAGE OF THE VALUE CHAIN SURROUNDING THE ISSUES OF QUALITY AND YIELD IS CONDUCTED. AN ANALYSIS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF VARIABLES, INCLUDING PROCESS FACTORS, PROCESS PARAMETERS AND WHEAT GRAIN QUALITY FROM DATA COLLECTED ON THE VALUE CHAIN ENABLES THE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS. FROM THESE MODELS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS AND OPTIMIZE THE WHEAT FLOUR MILLING PROCESS.

"THE INTERSECTION OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR1","A TRANSITION TOWARDS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY WITHIN THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR REQUIRES THE IMPROVEMENT OF EFFICIENCY IN RESOURCE UTILIZATION, THE PREVENTION OF FOOD LOSS OR WASTE, WHILST ADOPTING REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. IN ADDITION TO THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, THE AGRI-FOOD INDUSTRY NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS RESULTING FROM BIOMASS RECYCLING PROCESSES. INCREASINGLY, BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS GAINING TRACTION, MOVING TOWARDS MORE SUSTAINABLE AND PRECISION AGRICULTURE. THE BLOCKCHAIN IS A DECENTRALIZED, IMMUTABLE, AND SHARED DATABASE THAT RECORDS THE PROVENANCE OF DIGITAL ASSETS, MAKING IT A SUITABLE PLATFORM FOR TRACEABILITY AND FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT. DESPITE ITS GROWING IMPORTANCE, THE EXISTING LITERATURE REGARDING THESE THEMES AND THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR A CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS RATHER FRAGMENTED. THIS PAPER OFFERS A SCOPING REVIEW REGARDING THE ROLE OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IN THE TRANSITION TOWARDS A CIRCULAR FOOD SYSTEM. A TOTAL OF 44 PAPERS PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS WERE REVIEWED TO IDENTIFY NEW SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS INTO THE APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAINS WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS A GREAT POTENTIAL IN REDUCING FOOD LOSS THROUGH OPTIMIZED ECO-EFFICIENCY (E.G., DIGITALIZATION AND INTEGRATION WITH THE INTERNET OF THINGS) AND BY ALLEVIATING ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION (BY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND REDUCING DEPENDENCE ON INTERMEDIARIES). HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF RECYCLING EFFICIENCY, DESPITE ITS POTENTIAL, THERE REMAINS A PAUCITY OF EVIDENCE REGARDING THE USE OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IN IMPROVING THE RESIDUAL VALORIZATION PROCESSES. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A STREAM OF LITERATURE FOCUSING ON THE ABILITY OF BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED TRACEABILITY (E.G., FOR ORGANIC PRODUCTION OR SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT). YET, THE ROLE OF BLOCKCHAIN TRACEABILITY IN THE MONITORING OF RISKS FROM RECYCLED BIOMASS AND THE REPORTING OF THE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAS RECEIVED SCANT ATTENTION WITHIN RESEARCH LITERATURE.

"APPLYING IMAGE-BASED FOOD-RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ON DIETARY ASSESSMENT: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: THE LATEST ADVANCES OF COMPUTER VISION APPROACHES FOR DIETARY ASSESSMENT ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS REVIEW, AND RECENT APPLICATIONS OF IMAGE-BASED FOOD RECOGNITION SYSTEMS (IBFRS) IN PROFESSIONAL DIETETIC PRACTICE ARE PRESENTED. OPEN ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE TACKLED IN THE NEAR FUTURE VIA INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TO OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF IBFRS AS WELL AS TO INCREASE THEIR ADOPTION BY THE PROFESSIONALS OF THE FIELD HAVE BEEN EXAMINED AND DISCUSSED. DIETARY ASSESSMENT CAN BE CRUCIAL FOR THE OVERALL WELL-BEING OF HUMANS AND, AT LEAST IN SOME INSTANCES, FOR THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC, LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES. RECALL AND MANUAL RECORD-KEEPING METHODS FOR FOOD-INTAKE MONITORING ARE AVAILABLE, BUT OFTEN INACCURATE WHEN APPLIED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, AUTOMATIC RECORD-KEEPING APPROACHES THAT ADOPT MOBILE CAMERAS AND COMPUTER VISION METHODS SEEM TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS AND CAN IMPROVE CURRENT HUMAN-CENTRIC DIET-MONITORING METHODS. HERE WE PRESENT AN EXTENDED CRITICAL LITERATURE OVERVIEW OF IMAGE-BASED FOOD-RECOGNITION SYSTEMS (IBFRS) COMBINING A CAMERA OF THE USER'S MOBILE DEVICE WITH COMPUTER VISION METHODS AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FOOD DATASETS (PAFDS). IN BRIEF, SUCH SYSTEMS CONSIST OF SEVERAL PHASES, SUCH AS THE SEGMENTATION OF THE FOOD ITEMS ON THE PLATE, THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOOD ITEMS IN A SPECIFIC FOOD CATEGORY, AND THE ESTIMATION PHASE OF VOLUME, CALORIES, OR NUTRIENTS OF EACH FOOD ITEM. A TOTAL OF 159 STUDIES WERE SCREENED IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF IBFRS. A DETAILED OVERVIEW OF THE METHODS ADOPTED IN EACH OF THE 78 INCLUDED STUDIES OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF IBFRS IS PROVIDED ALONG WITH THEIR PERFORMANCE ON PAFDS. STUDIES THAT INCLUDED IBFRS WITHOUT PRESENTING THEIR PERFORMANCE IN AT LEAST 1 OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PHASES WERE EXCLUDED. AMONG THE INCLUDED STUDIES, 45 (58\%) STUDIES ADOPTED DEEP LEARNING METHODS AND ESPECIALLY CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) IN AT LEAST 1 PHASE OF THE IBFRS WITH INPUT PAFDS. AMONG THE IMPLEMENTED TECHNIQUES, CNNS OUTPERFORM ALL OTHER APPROACHES ON THE PAFDS WITH A LARGE VOLUME OF DATA, SINCE THE RICHNESS OF THESE DATASETS PROVIDES ADEQUATE TRAINING RESOURCES FOR SUCH ALGORITHMS. WE ALSO PRESENT EVIDENCE FOR THE BENEFITS OF APPLICATION OF IBFRS IN PROFESSIONAL DIETETIC PRACTICE. FURTHERMORE, CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE IBFRS PRESENTED HERE ARE ALSO THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED ALONG WITH FUTURE DIRECTIONS."
"COULD QSOR MODELLING AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES BE USEFUL TO PREDICT WINE AROMA?","FOOD INFORMATICS IS HAVING AN INCREASING IMPACT ON THE FOOD INDUSTRY AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF END PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE EFFICIENCY OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. IN THE CASE OF WINEMAKING, A PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF INTEREST FOR FOOD INFORMATICS IS THE SENSORY ANALYSIS OF WINES. THIS PROBLEM CAN BENEFIT FROM THE STRONG DEVELOPMENT THAT MACHINE LEARNING HAS ACHIEVED IN RECENT DECADES. HOWEVER, THESE DATA-DRIVEN TECHNIQUES REQUIRE ACCURATE AND SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO GENERATE MODELS CAPABLE OF PREDICTING THE SENSORY PROFILE OF WINES. A REVIEW OF THE SENSORY ANALYSIS AND VOLATILE COMPOSITION OF WINES IS PRESENTED IN THIS WORK, ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT STUDIES ON THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO PREDICT WINE-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY OF POLYPHENOLS OF WINE AND AROMA COMPOUNDS. IN THIS SENSE, DATA FROM A SENSORY PANEL AND ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGY WERE GATHERED. THIS LITERATURE REVIEW REVEALS THE LACK OF A HOMOGENEOUS AND SUFFICIENTLY LARGE DATABASE OF SENSORY ANALYSIS RELATED TO THE VOLATILE COMPOSITION OF WINES TO DEVELOP MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. HOWEVER, AMONG ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACHES, THE APPLICATION OF QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ODOUR RELATIONSHIP (QSOR) MODELS IS CURRENTLY GAINING IMPORTANCE. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PREDICT QUANTITATIVELY THE SENSORY ANALYSIS OF WINES BY QSOR MODELS, USING GENERAL VOLATILE COMPOSITION INFORMATION. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO IDENTIFY KEY ASPECTS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS AREA."
"HARNESSING FOOD PRODUCT REVIEWS FOR PERSONALIZING SWEETNESS LEVELS","SWEET TASTE IS INNATELY APPEALING, ENSURING THAT MAMMALS ARE ATTRACTED TO THE SWEETNESS OF MOTHER'S MILK AND OTHER SOURCES OF CARBOHYDRATES AND CALORIES. IN THE MODERN WORLD, THE AVAILABILITY OF SUGARS AND SWEETENERS AND THE EAGERNESS OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY TO MAXIMIZE PALATABILITY, RESULT IN AN ABUNDANCE OF SWEET FOOD PRODUCTS, WHICH POSES A MAJOR HEALTH CHALLENGE. THE AIM OF THE CURRENT STUDY IS TO ANALYZE SWEETNESS LEVELS, LIKING, AND INGREDIENTS OF ONLINE REVIEWS OF FOOD PRODUCTS, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INSIGHTS INTO SENSORY NUTRITION AND TO IDENTIFY NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECONCILING THE PALATABILITY-HEALTHINESS TENSION. WE COLLECTED OVER 200,000 REVIEWS OF SIMILAR TO 30,000 PRODUCTS ON AMAZON DATED FROM 2002 TO 2012 AND SIMILAR TO 350,000 REVIEWS OF SIMILAR TO 2400 PRODUCTS ON IHERB FROM 2006 TO 2021. THE REVIEWS WERE CLASSIFIED AND ANALYZED USING MANUAL CURATION, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, AND MACHINE LEARNING.

OVERSWEET REVIEWS WERE DISPERSED AMONG CONSUMERS. PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDED SUCRALOSE HAD MORE OVERSWEET REVIEWS THAN AVERAGE. 26 PRODUCTS HAD AT LEAST 50 REVIEWS FOR WHICH AT LEAST 10\% WERE OVERSWEET. FOR THESE PRODUCTS, THE AVERAGE LIKING BY CONSUMERS REPORTING OVERSWEETNESS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (BY 0.9 STARS ON AVERAGE ON A 1 TO 5 STARS SCALE) THAN BY THE REST OF THE CONSUMERS. IN SUMMARY, OVERSWEETNESS APPEARS IN 7-16\% OF THE SWEETNESS-RELATED REVIEWS AND IS LESS LIKED, WHICH SUGGESTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CUSTOMIZED PRODUCTS WITH REDUCED SWEETNESS. THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE SIMULTANEOUSLY HEALTHIER AND TASTIER FOR A SUBSTANTIAL SUBGROUP OF CUSTOMERS AND WILL BENEFIT THE MANUFACTURER BY EXPANDING THE PRODUCTS' TARGET AUDIENCE. ANALYSIS OF CONSUMERS' REVIEWS OF MARKETED FOOD PRODUCTS OFFERS NEW WAYS TO OBTAIN INFORMATIVE SENSORY DATA."

CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH HAS HIGHLIGHTED ITS POTENTIAL FOR THE INSPECTION AND GRADING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. COMPUTER VISION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED FOR THE QUALITY ANALYSIS OF MEAT AND FISH, PIZZA, CHEESE, AND BREAD. LIKEWISE GRAIN QUALITY AND CHARACTERISTICS HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY THIS TECHNIQUE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF A COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM AND EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUE COUPLED WITH A REVIEW OF THE MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS THROUGHOUT THE FOOD INDUSTRY.

"DEVELOPMENTS IN MONITORING AND CONTROL OF FOOD PROCESSES","RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ADVANCED CONTROL TECHNIQUES HAVE OPENED UP NOVEL POSSIBILITIES FOR FOOD PROCESS CONTROL. FOOD PROCESSES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO AUTOMATE AND CONTROL OWING TO NONUNIFORMITY AND VARIABILITY IN RAW-MATERIALS, AND LACK OF SENSORS FOR REAL-TIME MONITORING OF KEY PROCESS VARIABLES AND QUALITY ATTRIBUTES. MODEL-BASED CONTROL, DISTRIBUTED CONTROL SYSTEMS TOGETHER WITH FIELD COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS, AND OTHER COMPUTER-AIDED ADVANCED CONTROL STRATEGIES ARE ALREADY WIDELY USED IN CHEMICAL PROCESS INDUSTRIES, AND HAVE PROVEN THEMSELVES IN SELECTED FOOD PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. THE BENEFITS OF ADVANCED CONTROL TECHNIQUES INCLUDE REDUCED COSTS, INCREASED QUALITY, AND IMPROVED SAFETY. FUZZY LOGIC AND NEURAL NETWORKS PROVIDE CONVENIENT MEANS FOR DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES AND HIGHLY NON-LINEAR EVENTS TYPICAL OF BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. NEVERTHELESS, REPLACING THE HUMAN EXPERT BY COMPUTER-AIDED SYSTEMS IN BIOENGINEERING HAS BEEN SLOWER THAN IN OTHER PROCESS INDUSTRIES, AND THERE ARE FEW PUBLISHED LANDMARK CASES. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE POTENTIAL OF SUCH NOVEL TOOLS IN FOOD PROCESS CONTROL."
"`ELECTRONIC NOSES' AND THEIR APPLICATION TO FOOD","`ELECTRONIC NOSE' SYSTEMS INVOLVE VARIOUS TYPES OF ELECTRONIC CHEMICAL GAS SENSORS WITH PARTIAL SPECIFICITY, AS WELL AS SUITABLE STATISTICAL METHODS ENABLING THE RECOGNITION OF COMPLEX ODOURS. AS COMMERCIAL INSTRUMENTS HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE, A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN RESEARCH INTO THE APPLICATION OF ELECTRONIC NOSES IN THE EVALUATION OF VOLATILE COMPOUNDS IN FOOD COSMETIC AND OTHER ITEMS OF EVERYDAY EVERYDAY LIFE IS OBSERVED. AT PRESENT, THE COMMERCIAL GAS SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES COMPRISE METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTORS, METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS, ORGANIC CONDUCTING POLYMERS, AND PIEZOELECTRIC CRYSTAL SENSORS. FURTHER SENSORS BASED ON FIBREOPTIC, ELECTROCHEMICAL AND BI-METAL PRINCIPLES ARE STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES RANGE FROM SIMPLE GRAPHICAL EVALUATION TO MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK AND RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION. THE INTRODUCTION OF ELECTRONIC NOSES INTO THE AREA OF FOOD IS ENVISAGED FOR QUALITY CONTROL, PROCESS MONITORING, FRESHNESS EVALUATION, SHELF-LIFE INVESTIGATION AND AUTHENTICITY ASSESSMENT. CONSIDERABLE WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN CARRIED OUT ON MEAT, GRAINS COFFEE, MUSHROOMS, CHEESE, SUGAR, FISH, BEER AND OTHER BEVERAGES, AS WELL AS ON THE ODOUR QUALITY EVALUATION OF FOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL.
